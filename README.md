## 👋 Hi there! I'm Luca

- 👨‍💻 I am currently working as a LoRaWAN Logger & Gateway Specialist, learning new technologies and the fascinating world of these embedded devices.
  I previously worked as a Project Engineer | Project Manager, for projects related to electromechanical systems  on streets, highways and tunnels in the Swiss area.

- :heart: I decided to learn more about software development, a personal passion that I have never had a chance to explore further, until now. I love automating processes and continuous improvement; it is my lifestyle. As a great quote says: “if you do what you love, you will not work a single day of your life”. I am attending a Mentorship program on development knowledge.
Current study JavaScript - nodeJS.

- :globe_with_meridians: Passionate about Bitcoin and blockchain technology.
